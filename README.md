- 👋 Hi, I’m @kriskornel, struggling amateur painter but good enough backend programmer (i hope so). I've made a lot of mistakes and still making some mistakes.
- 👀 I’m interested in building web platform using php (symfony, laravel),  nodejs + typescript, deno and java clojure.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning functional programming. I believe that TAO of programming exists that's why i'm seeking it through all programming paradigms from OO to Procedural, from Procedural to Functional, from functional to Functional Reactive Programming.
- 💞️ If you need some help with building web based platform you can reach me. I can help to build your platform from small blog to big ecommerce, from static jamstack site to RESTfull dynamic site, from scratch to already made cms opensource by creating new plugins.
