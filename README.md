Hey there, I'm @kriskornel, an artist struggling to make sense of paint and a backend programmer who's probably good enough (fingers crossed). I've painted my fair share of coding masterpieces, but let's be real, there's always a bug lurking somewhere.

👀 I'm all about crafting web wonders using PHP (Symfony, Laravel), Node.js with TypeScript, Deno, and Java Clojure. It's like juggling flaming chainsaws, but in code.

🌱 Currently, I'm on a quest to understand functional programming. Because who needs simple loops when you can have monads, right? I'm chasing the TAO of programming through Object-Oriented, Procedural, Functional, and whatever new-fangled paradigm comes my way.

💞️ Need a hand with your web escapades? Hit me up! I can help turn your digital daydreams into reality, whether it's a humble blog or an e-commerce extravaganza. From a static Jamstack site to a dynamic RESTful spectacle, I've got you covered. And hey, if your CMS is feeling a bit meh, I'll spice it up with plugins that'll make it the talk of the town.

📫 Shoot me a message at korneliuskristian@gmail.com, and let's turn your digital chaos into a masterpiece – one line of code at a time!
